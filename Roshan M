Step 1: Deleting Vote Pod:

Before Deleting:
root@ip-172-31-45-131:~# kubectl get po
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
vote-7d884dd585-mpgp7     1/1     Running   0              5m2s

root@ip-172-31-45-131:~# kubectl delete pod vote-7d884dd585-mpgp7
pod "vote-7d884dd585-mpgp7" deleted

Pod Deletion: The pod "vote-7d884dd585-mpgp7" was successfully deleted.

After Deleting:
root@ip-172-31-45-131:~# kubectl get po
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
vote-7d884dd585-n7594     1/1     Running   0               9s

Pod Replacement: Kubernetes automatically created a new pod "vote-7d884dd585-n7594" to maintain the desired state.

complete the assignment by making the result pod work ?

* In the process of managing the pods within the Kubernetes cluster, each pod underwent a deletion operation followed by the creation of a replacement pod to maintain the application's functionality. 

* Initially, the vote pod was deleted, and subsequently, a new pod was created to take its place. Similarly, the worker pod was removed, and a new one was spawned to ensure the seamless operation of 
  the application. Lastly, the database pod underwent deletion, after which a fresh pod was instantiated to uphold the database functionality.

* Throughout this process, Kubernetes effectively orchestrated the deletion and recreation of the pods, ensuring minimal disruption to the application's availability and performance. This demonstrates
  the robustness of Kubernetes in managing containerized workloads and maintaining the desired state of the application components.
